#OS161 Project#

This project is a version of OS161 extended with a partner for a University of Toronto Operating Systems course.

Completed or partially completed sections include synchronization primatives, syscalls (allowing programs to be run), and virtual memory. These are in the kern/ directory, mostly in the vm, userprog, asst1, and synch sub-directories.

Note: The additions made to OS161 are the intellectual property of its creators. If you are currently in ECE344 please do not attempt to copy this code as that is plagiarism.

(The lack of VCS/SCM history is due to difficulties importing it from SVN)
